## CleverTouch Technical Test

Firstly, thank you for having me for an interview. It was an absolute pleasure to see people so excited and passionate about their work, something I think is so important for a company and its culture.

I hope you find my skills and abilities to be up to snuff, I like to think I'm pretty good at what I do!

All told it took me about 2 hours but that was probably down to me not taking the easy route on the navbar challenge!

Please see the below checklist of completed items

- [x] Look for issues on the page layout and fix them - There are at least 5
- [x] Remove the area in the carousel that says "Mens Shoes" but make sure that the positioning of the other elements does not change. 
- [x] In the new collection area, make the black "New" button align with the top left of the shoe container
- [x] Add another carousel item
- [x] Add another item to the page navigation
- [x] In the new arrivals products section, change the layout to show the shoes in rows of three.
- [x] Using javascript, submit the form via javascript, redirecting the page back to itself. Scroll the page to the form, remove the form, and show a thank you message where the form once was. 

Cheers,
